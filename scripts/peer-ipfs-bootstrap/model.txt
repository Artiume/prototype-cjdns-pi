Deps:
jq, cjdns, cjdnstool, ipfs

Many things can be changed now that jq is installed -- getting stuff from cjdroute.conf for example
The "installed" parameter in nodeinfo.json should be in addition to a version number once we create a versioning system.

Setup nginx /nodeinfo.json 
setup install uninstall, docs, status, etc.
setup .service -- wait for ipfs, networking and cjdns to start first

Logging
Rework so that it loops over peers -
Peers are removed a list as they are checked, and _their peers_ are
added to the bottom. It ends when there are 4 peers, by default.

~~~
On boot it checks the ipfs peers to see whether there are any
ipfs swarm peers | wc -l
if there aren't it asks all cjdns peers whether they are ipfs nodes
preferably by checking a /info address, or by requesting a specific hash through their gateway
if there aren't any 1 hop peers with ipfs, it goes onto the peers of those peers, and so on
ideally this happens more than just at boot, but for now it's only at boot
